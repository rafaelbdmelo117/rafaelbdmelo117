Hello! I'm Rafael Barbosa and I'm a Software Engineering student at Universidade de Brasília.
I'm currently focused on studying Java and also on my university team's project: FGR!
I really am fascinated by the area of image, graphics, games and video processing within programming developed by companies like Nvidia!
Well, that's enough for now. I still have a lot to learn and to improve, but I hope there's something you like within my repositories 😁
